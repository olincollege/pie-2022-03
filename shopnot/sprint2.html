				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>In sprint 2, we focused on working on the other half of the concept we did not work on in sprint 1:
					the gantry system that moves the tool head. We ended up applying a lot of the learning we gained in
					sprint 1, working more precisely with stepper motors and making a robust cutting platform.</p>
				<h2>Mechanical</h2>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/sprints/sprint_2.png" alt="" /></span>In sprint 2, we produced our first prototype X-Y gantry. We originally planned to finish the gantry
					in this sprint and simply attach it. At this point our plan was to move the spindle head in all 3
					axes while the material stays still and secured.</p>
				<p>This plan meant a lot of work in simply creating a frame/chassis to put it in. The entire chassis was
					constructed from a collection of different sizes of 8020 t-slotted extruded aluminum. At this point,
					we developed the plan to use lead screws and linear rods in our final designs. Both of them would
					work well enough and were cheap enough to be viable. We used some NEMA 14 motors acquired from a
					scavenged 3D printer to move these lead screws.</p>
				<p>Almost the entire gantry was manufactured primarily using a horizontal bandsaw and drill press.
					Regrettably, this meant that tolerances weren't very high, and the linear rods ended up not
					perfectly parallel and some parts were not properly aligned. This led to the motors encountering a
					lot of resistance and would lead to a bad cut if we were to use it further.</p>
				<h2>Electrical</h2>
				<p>We upgraded from the Arduino motor shield in the previous sprint to a CNC shield, which allowed us to
					control both the X and Y stepper motors in this sprint. For this sprint we also implemented limit
					switches on both axes and a switch to act as an emergency stop, which we were also able to wire to
					the CNC shield. As we were not using the tool head in this sprint, we powered all of our electronics
					off of a 12V power supply.</p>
				<h2>Software</h2>
				<p>In this sprint we focused on pivoting to using GRBL to control our gantry movements. We spent time
					learning how to use GRBL with our Arduino, as well as learning how to use Universal G-Code Sender to
					communicate with GRBL. We held off on running more advanced movements, preferring to focus on
					configuring GRBL and UGS with our limit switches and steppers, only moving the gantry via jogging.
