				<h2>Firmware</h2>
				<p>In our original vision for the project, we expected to be writing our own g-code generator and
					interpreter. As mentioned in our electrical systems summary, we decided to use a Protoneer CNC
					Shield, as it was an easy way for our Arduino to interface with the number of steppers we needed,
					along with limit switches and other accessories. When researching the CNC Shield, we discovered its
					compatibility with the <a href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl">GRBL firmware</a>. GRBL presented the
					perfect opportunity for us to focus our time on configuring, tuning, and perfecting our system while
					based on an existing open-source firmware, as opposed to writing a g-code interpreter from scratch.
					Although it meant we wrote less code for this project, not reinventing the wheel allowed us to focus
					on rock-solid integration of our CNC router.
				<p></p>
				<p>We did have to change some of the pre-configuration options of our GRBL source code to allow our DC
					motor driver access to the hardware PWM capabilities of pin 11 on the Arduino.</p>

				<h2>Software</h2>
				<p>Once we decided to use GRBL, we searched for a piece of open-source software that would allow us to
					generate and send basic g-code commands to our Arduino. We settled on <a
						href="https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/">Universal G-code Sender</a> as our sender of
					choice. We used UGS to jog the gantry, testing our steppers and gantry. We were also able to use UGS
					to edit GRBL's configuration variables, tuning axis lengths, max speed and accelerations, and
					initializing our limit switches.</p>
				<p>Once we got experience working with UGS, we were able to calibrate our limit switches at the positive
					end of each axis, adding soft limits at the negative extremes. We also added a homing routing to all
					3 limit switches, activated by sending the `$H` command. We also developed a standard setup
					procedure to zero all three axes and get the machine ready to cut.</p>
				<p>Once we progressed past configuration and jogging, we wanted to be able to design and generate g-code
					for simple patterns and shapes. This was easy, since UGS has this functionality built-in. However,
					since UGS can also send g-code files generated by other software tools, we are hoping to experiment
					with the 3D CAM capabilities of Fusion 360 and/or HSMWorks to generate much more complex 3D
					toolpaths.</p>

				<h2>GitHub</h2>
				<p>Although we did not end up writing any code in the final version of the machine, our GitHub includes
					our sprint 1 code, wiring diagram, demo cut files, and GRBL files necessary to recompile and flash
					our configuration of GRBL to the CNC router.</p>
