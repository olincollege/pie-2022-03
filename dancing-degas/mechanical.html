                <h3>Mechanical System Overview</h3>
                <p>We chose to base the system on a horizontal x-y gantry to provide the most flexibility in the type of
                    visualization we could produce. The goal was to create a gantry that could move a pen over a piece
                    of paper according to the design generated by the music visualization software and that the
                    mechanism could also change the color of the pen. We also aimed to minimize the use of materials and
                    to make the machine easy to assemble and disassemble. We designed the drawing gantry in SolidWorks,
                    and the primary manufacturing techniques were 3D printing and laser cutting, which allowed us to
                    easily make edits to our prototypes.
                </p>

                <h3>Gantry Frame</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">

                        <p>The frame of the gantry is a U-shape made of two 50 cm bars of 20mm x 20mm v-slot
                            extruded
                            aluminum, crossed on one end by another 50 cm bar of the same material. To achieve the
                            y-motion, another piece of aluminum rail is mounted to each y-axis bar on a rolling
                            carriage
                            made from laser cut MDF so that the entire bar can slide in the y-direction. Another
                            carriage, which holds the color changing motor and pens, is mounted vertically on the
                            x-axis
                            bar. The frame is primarily held together by screws and nuts inserted in the rails,
                            which
                            hold in place the motor and pulley mounts as well as the 3D printed L-brackets at the
                            corner
                            of the frame. The aluminum is mounted to a plywood base, which adds a structure to place
                            the
                            drawing surface on and ensures that the frame is held at perpendicular angles, as we
                            found
                            that without this support the entire frame would shift and prevent the x-axis rail from
                            moving across the entire y-axis.

                <h3>X-Y Motion</h3>
                <p>
                    The x-y motion is driven by two NEMA 17 stepper motors, one for each axis. The
                    y-axis motor is mounted with a 3D printed mount to the end of one of the y-axis
                    bars, on the other end of this bar is another mount with a 6mm GT2 pulley. Between
                    these is a timing belt that attaches to the carriage. On the opposite side there is
                    no motor, but a corresponding pair of pulleys and belts. In the interest of
                    simplicity, we wanted to use only one motor to drive the y-axis. One challenge with
                    this was overcoming the torque created by having a friction force from the opposite
                    carriage applied at a distance from the applied force of the motor. Our first
                    stepper motor had a torque of 20 N-cm, not quite strong enough to overcome this
                    torque, so we exchanged it for a stronger Nema 17 stepper motor with 42 N-cm of
                    torque.

                <h3>Pen Mechanism</h3>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
                        <p>The pen holder is designed to hold the marker in steady as the gantry draws,
                            and also allows us to change color to make the art more visually
                            interesting. We felt that having multiple colors would allow us to reflect
                            more aspects of the music. Originally, the pen holder was made from a piece
                            of laser cut material, and was held in place with a pair of spacers
                            sandwiching the disk as seen in figure 3. While laser cutting has the
                            potential to be a less material and time intensive manufacturing process, we
                            found that the piece wiggled too much to allow for the precise spirograph
                            design we wanted.The final pen holder is therefore made from a single 3D
                            printed piece that press fits onto the motor shaft. The pens also fit snugly
                            into their holders and can be adjusted slightly to make contact with the
                            paper. This is one feature that left room for improvement, as tweaking the
                            position of the pens to make precisely the right amount of contact with the
                            paper was extremely finicky. We also found that the wood base was not
                            perfectly level as the wood was a bit warped, so sometimes the pen did not
                            fully contact the paper for all parts of the drawing.</p>

                    <h3>Learnings and Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>We were overall very pleased with the final gantry, though there are
                        some things that we would do differently in the future. The motion
                        in the y-direction, while greatly improved by the measures taken
                        during our sprints, is still sometimes a bit choppy due to friction.
                        Another source of inaccuracy is the unevenness of the wooden base,
                        which could easily be fixed with a different piece of wood – ideally
                        not two pieces glued together. We had originally planned the drawing
                        area to be larger, hence the wide space between the drawing surface
                        and the frame. Scaling down the entire gantry could help reduce the
                        amount of torque on the y-motor. Alternatively, linking two stepper
                        motors and driving the gantry on both sides could help with the
                        problem of driving the y-axis. We also discovered that the rattling
                        of the carriages caused the nut on the bottom of the V-wheels to
                        fall off periodically, which we fixed by adding another hex nut to
                        the m-5 screws. A better solution might have been to use lock nuts.
                        One thing we did well was that everything was easy to take apart,
                        which has the dual benefit of making the components recyclable and
                        also is super helpful for repeated iteration, as this typically
                        involves taking everything apart and putting it back together.
                        Another nice feature of the x-y gantry is the diversity of
                        applications; it offers the affordance of creating different
                        designs, not just spirographs.
