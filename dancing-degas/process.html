                <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
                <p>For our first sprint we wanted to test out a drawing mechanism. No one on our team had experience
                    with gantry so we wanted to learn about them first in order to decide the scope of our project. We
                    made a vertical X-Y gantry in less than two weeks that used servo motors and weight to center the
                    pen holder in the middle. We found after our sprint that the design worked well but only for one
                    color and we felt that in order to fully visualize music, we need multiple. A multiple color
                    mechanism would be difficult with a vertical gantry system because of gravity so we decided to shift
                    to a horizontal X-Y gantry like those found in 3d printers. We also found that our initial design
                    was pretty quick and we wanted more of a challenge. Our software/electrical team found that
                    calibrating the motors took more time than expected and knew that it needed more attention in the
                    future.</p>

                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
                        <p>This sprint provided a good proof of concept and gave the mechanical team a nice challenge to
                            warm up with. During this sprint, we researched different kinds of gantries and chose the
                            vertical gantry because of its relative simplicity, it only required two motors and gravity.
                            We used a combination of sketch modeling techniques and rapid prototyping to quickly
                            manufacture
                            a cardboard frame with 3D printed motor mounts, pen holder, and pulleys. Testing this system
                            revealed some of the challenges we might need to think about when designing a gantry. These
                            included friction and slippage on the pulleys, the importance of keeping parts linear and
                            rigid,
                            as well as considerations of required torque to overcome the forces of gravity and friction
                            caused by the drawing mechanism.

                        <p>
                            For Sprint 1, software focused on writing scripts to control the servos in order to
                            draw different shapes with out gantry. We discovered that while the code worked for the
                            servos
                            when they were not integrated, upon integration the pulleys would slip off the servos, which
                            meant we were not able to test if the shapes were drawn correctly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we decided to pivot towards a horizontal gantry system, we turned our
                            attention towards figuring out how we wanted to process the audio data. As we
                            brainstormed
                            potential methods, we focused on having a simple circuit with LEDs that lit up when
                            audio
                            input was detected.

                        <p>
                            At the end of this sprint, we decided that our next priority was to have the drawing
                            commands be different depending on audio input -- essentially integrating
                            our audio processing with gantry control. However, we knew this would be a significant
                            change
                            as we would also be dealing with a different gantry system and different motors.

                <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
                <p>In sprint 2 we made a lot of progress. We fully shifted to a horizontal X-Y gantry and were able to
                    achieve a working gantry in two weeks. We had to order a lot of our parts this sprint like V-slot
                    rails, wheels, stepper motors, belts, and pulleys. For the software side, we translated Cartesian
                    coordinate to motor motion and began working on the spiral art design. From this sprint, we decided
                    to stick with the mechanical design but to work on reducing friction and adding stability. We
                    decided that we needed a CNC motor shield which is better suited to X-Y gantry systems.</p>

                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
                        <p>During this sprint, we learned some of the basics of creating a gantry with extruded
                            aluminum.
                            For example, we learned the difference between T-slot and V-slot. For our purposes, because
                            we wanted a v-wheel carriage that rolled smoothly on our gantry, we decided to use V-slot
                            aluminum. The rails are also anodized to a nice black color, which looks sleek. In this
                            sprint we implemented two out of three stepper motors, both mounted on one side of the
                            gantry.
                            These were Nema 17 steppers with a torque of 20 N-cm. After an integrated test, however, we
                            found that these motors couldn't quite drive the gantry with the required speed and
                            precision.
                            The test drive of this system was successful but super slow! We also noticed that the timing
                            belts did not have enough room and were rubbing against the wheels.

                            For sprint 2, the software team decided that to visualize music using spirographs.
                            Consequently, we dedicated time to understanding the formulae that produce
                            spirographs and
                            translating the formulae into functions that return positions. Software modified
                            these
                            formulae by having the parameters be determined by the most salient frequencies in
                            the
                            fourier transform of the audio signal. A deeper explanation of these formulae can be
                            found
                            on the <a href="software.html">Software page</a>.

                            Additionally, software also
                            figure out simple motor control commands through Arduino. However, we ultimately decided to
                            switch to using the CNC shield to simplify the simultaneous movement of multiple motors.

                <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
                <p>Our last sprint mainly focused on the spiral art algorithm and converting the position to Gcode
                    commands. We also built a user interface where the user can pick a song. On the mechanical side, we
                    added a base, acrylic board, and the color changing mechanism. We worked a lot as a whole team on
                    integrating and testing small problems during this sprint and after. </p>

                    <div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
                        <p>The main issues we aimed to address in sprint 3 were reducing friction in the gantry,
                            particularly in the y-direction as the motor was having a hard time moving the
                            entire x-axis bar across the frame while being driven from just one side. We made
                            a number of minor edits to give it a helping hand, including moving the timing belts
                            slightly away from the wheels. We also mounted the gantry to a wooden base to keep
                            everything at right angles. Both of these significantly improved the performance.
                            Unfortunately, one of our motors stopped working, likely due to burnout. At this point,
                            we decided to shift to a stronger, 42 N-cm stepper motor. Another feature we worked on
                            was the holder for the pens, which was originally made from a disc of laser cut material.
                            We found that this design was a bit wobbly so we designed a 3D printed pen wheel
                            instead.

                        <p>To integrate with the CNC shield, the software team decided to use GCode and GRBL. Software
                            learned how to create and write to GCode files, as well as which GCode commands were the
                            most pertinent for the project. Additionally, software also learned how to stream the GCode

                <h3>Final Deliverable</h3>
                <p>
                    Our final tasks included adding multiple concentric spirals and implementing a color changing
                    mechanism from a software perspective.

                        <p>During our last week leading up to demo day, the mechanical team focused on tidying up the
                            design
                            and making minor changes to make the gantry draw as smoothly and precisely as possible. We
                            created
                            a frame to hold the acrylic canvas in place and painted everything black. We also reprinted
                            the
                            holder for the pen wheel motor so that the motor could be screwed in place.

                        <p>The first task the software team tackled was the ability to have multiple concentric
                            spirographs. The problems we had in previous sprints with secondary spirographs appearing in
                            incorrect locations was resolved by having all of the spiral positions be dependent on
                            previous spirals. To test if the spirals were geerated correctly before moving the gantry,
                            we used Universal GCode Server, which produced images such as to the right. To implement the
                            color changing mechanism, we modified how we calibrated
                            the motor responsible for the color wheel, which enabled easy transition between colors.
