                            create a simple graphical user interface. We decided that a Tkinter window was a sufficient

                            the user
                            only needs to enter a song and then choose an option from a dropdown. Additionally, we
                            decided to
                            use the package `ttkthemes` in order to style the simple Tkinter window.

                            the

                            which then triggers the visualization of the song. After clicking the aforementioned button,

                            Our initial approach was to use a Fourier transform to analyze music. However, this
                            presented two
                            issues. Firstly, the information from a Fourier transform doesn’t exactly translate 1:1 with
                            the
                            note and pitch information about the song because the Fourier transform also captures things
                            like
                            the harmonics of the note played as well as rhythmic information. Secondly, the information
                            from the
                            transform is also generally “surface-level”; it is only a secondary representation of raw
                            audio
                            data, and it’s not particularly artistic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through our design reviews, we learned about a Spotify API that does a far more complex
                            musical
                            analysis and tells things about a song such as how danceable it is or what the general
                            emotional
                            mood is (on a sad to happy continuum). However, in order to use this API to analyze a given
                            song, we
                            would have to provide the song’s Spotify ID. Actually obtaining this ID from a
                            user-perspective
                            isn’t super-straightforward; sometimes, the ID appears in the Spotify URL for a song, but
                            most
                            people use Spotify on their phone or as a desktop app. However, Spotify itself also provides
                            a very
                            easy solution to this: they have another API for searching for a song by either its title or
                            its
                            artist. Each song returned from this API given a keyword search is paired with its ID, and
                            then the
                            ID of the correct song (which the user chooses from the list) is sent right back to Spotify
                            for
                            analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, integrating the Spotify API not only solved the problem of doing more
                            complicated and
                            artistic musical analysis, but it also provided the scaffolding for creating user
                            interaction
                            through its song-search API. The alternative route, staying with the Fourier transform,
                            would’ve
                            been far more complicated: we would have had to use one API to find the ID of, say, a
                            YouTube video,
                            and then another API to download the audio data from that YouTube ID, and it would’ve all
                            been for
                            less gain than just simply using Spotify.

                <h3>Spirograph</h3>

                <p>
                    We determined early-on that we wanted to create some sort of parametric art, the parameters
                    of which
                    would be determined by music. In exploring different kinds of parametric art, some course
                    assistants
                    pointed us in the direction of Spirographs. The Spirograph is a toy that gears of varying
                    size to
                    draw spiral patterns on a piece of paper. Luckily for us, we found that the Wikipedia page
                    for the
                    Spirograph provided parametric equations for computationally “drawing” Spirograph spirals.
                    We spent
                    some time playing with these equations, becoming familiar with how the different variables
                    affect
                    the final design. We were interested in our design being several concentric circular
                    rings/bands,
                    where each ring would be a spirograph. For this, we had to figure out a way to constrain the
                    variables in the parametric equation to produce a spiral of a given inner and outer radius.
                </p>
                <p>After determining how to constrain the variables, we discovered that there was some sort of
                    periodicity to our parameters; at certain values, the design would look “clean.” We realized
                    that
                    some designs seemed to be infinitely complex, and that if you drew them long enough, you
                    would just
                    draw a completely filled-in circle. In the interest of making sure that our final designs
                    were both
                    neat and also drawable in a reasonable amount of time, we spent some time trying to
                    determine what
                    values would produce these clean spirals. And while we did figure out a further constraint
                    on the
                    parametric equation variables that would always produce clean spirals, we unfortunately
                    realized
                    that there were a very small number of clean designs. So in the end, we decided to introduce
                    new
                    variables to our Spirograph generator: the range of the parametric variable, and the
                    step-size of
                    the parametric variable. We decided to draw each of the concentric spirals with a fixed
                    range and
                    step to help ensure that drawing any spiral wouldn’t take too long. Increasing the range
                    increases
                    the complexity of the drawing, but going too far makes the drawing look messy (especially if
                    the
                    parameters chosen didn’t produce a clean spiral). Decreasing the step-size increases the
                    resolution
                    of the drawing because curves actually look like curves instead of jagged lines, but this
                    also
                    greatly increases the drawing time. Besides those two variables, the last three are: inner
                    and outer
                    radius, and a parameter that helps control the complexity in the spiral, but due to the
                    nature of
                    the Spirograph, each variable contributes some amount to the complexity.
                </p>
                <p>A final problem we had was in determining scaling. In the code, the function that generates
                    the
                    points on the spiral can return those points within any arbitrary range because, depending
                    on the
                    calibration of the gantry motors, a given number can translate to any real-world distance.
                    To handle
                    this uncertainty, we normalized the points returned from spiral code to be in the range
                    [-1,1],
                    calibrated the motors so that one step was one centimeter, and then simply scaled all the
                    points
                    from the spiral code by a fixed scalar depending on how big we wanted the spirals to go.
                    This was
                    much more manageable than modifying the spiral code each time we needed to adjust the spiral
                    size. All of the code related to the spirographs is located in our `prerecorded.py` file
                    found in
                    our
                    source code.

                    that we could not have the motors move synchronously. Consequently, we had to determine the
                    slope of
                    the line we had to draw and then use proportions to determine how large of a step each motor
                    had to
                    take at each time step in the movement from one position to another. This resulted in a
                    “staircase-like” design, as opposed to the smooth curves for which we were aiming.

                <p>
                    While we considered looking into Arduino libraries for multithreaded control for synchronous
                    movement, we ultimately decided to switch to using a CNC Motor Shield alongside GRBL, which
                    simplified the process of simultaneous movement of motors.

                <p>
                    After flashing the GRBL onto the motor shield, all we had to worry about was generating
                    GCode files
                    that defined the appropriate movement of the motors. Ultimately, we decided to use the
                    relative
                    positioning command to send the change in position that was required. All of the code
                    related to
                    GRBL control is located in our `controlGRBL.py` file found in our source code.

                <p>
                    Although the final product required multidisciplinary integration, we found it important to
                    have
                    individual macro-components (i.e. hardware, electrical and software) and micro-components
                    (e.g.
                    different parts of software) working in isolation before moving towards integration. For
                    example,
                    while the gantry was being built, the software team needed to be programming the gantry, but
                    there
                    was nothing built yet. And even when the gantry was working, testing software required
                    interrupting
                    the mechanical team. In order to get around this, we discovered a piece of software called
                    the
                    Universal GCode Sender. We used this tool primarily for debugging the CNC shield and
                    calibrating
                    motors. But we also discovered a sort-of simulation tool that allowed us to see how the
                    gantry would
                    draw our designs. This allowed us to test out changes in software without commandeering the
                    gantry,
                    and also importantly allowed for very quick iteration; if something was wrong with the
                    design, we
                    would know in a matter of seconds, rather than having to wait for the gantry to finish
                    drawing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, we found using external software tools to be very helpful in this
                    fast-prototyping. For
                    example, when exploring parametric designs, we leveraged tools such as MATLAB and the Desmos
                    graphing calculator to not only visualize different designs we discovered, but also to get
                    hands-on
                    and explore how each parameter would affect the design. Overall, the software was all done
                    in a very
                    modular approach. Each code file was made to have its own purpose: one file would run the
                    interface,
                    one file would create the spirals, one file would generate the GCode, etc. Using this
                    approach, we
                    would make sure that each component was fully functional within the software system. As
                    components
                    were completed, they were integrated into one another (often by simply importing the other
                    code
                    files, since we were using Python). In the end, we were left with a nicely-bundled software
                    system
                    that was ready to be integrated with the electrical and mechanical parts.
