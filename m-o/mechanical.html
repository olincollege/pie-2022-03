                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Our goal was to create a movie accurate replica of M-O from the Disney movie WALL-E. While
                            designing
                            our version of M-O, we heavily referenced a 3D render that was found online. Furthermore, we
                            designed everything by hand as there were no pre-existing CAD models that we could use as a
                            base
                            for
                            our design.</p>
                        <p>The body was created in a series of stages - a simple cardboard box, a laser cut box, a
                            skeleton
                            laser cut box, and the final body. The main materials used in the final project were
                            plywood,
                            acrylic, and PLA. All of our parts were either 3D printed or laser cut. The curved features
                            of
                            the
                            head were made by heating acrylic with a heat gun and then bending it.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <h4>Body</h4>
                        <p>The first step in designing the body was determining what size to make it. We wanted to make
                            the size as accurate to the movie as possible, so we found the official heights of some of
                            the characters in the main cast of WALL-E and calculated the proportion of their pixel
                            height to M-O's pixel height. As a result, we decided to go with 9''x9''x9'' box for our
                            skeleton.</p>
                        <p>One of our other design requirements was to make the top of the box easily removable in order
                            to allow enough space to fit our hands into or for more components. We designed the shell
                            first and then created a similarly shaped skeleton inside.</p>
                        <p>The skeleton was manufactured by laser cutting ¼’’ plywood in order to get exact measurements
                            and straight edges. The laser cutter was also used to make holes in the acrylic sheets that
                            were then heat bent over the skeleton to create the curved shells on M-O's head and body.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Head</h4>
                        <p>The head of M-O was designed using the same process as the body for the overall shape and
                            structure. The neck of M-O made to hold the head to the body was designed as a column to
                            match the cylindrical nature of M-O's actual neck, though we couldn't replicate all its
                            functionality. Initially we set out to design a neck that would both enable M-O's head to
                            turn side-to-side and raise up and down, however after finding these goals unrealistic we
                            settled for a head that could only pan side-to-side.
                        </p>
                        <p>This was achieved with a servo sitting at the base of the neck with four ball bearings on a
                            circular track around it, allowing it to rotate while providing more balance than we would
                            have putting all the head's weight on one servo. Four laser-cut supports then extend from
                            the circular servo attachment and are secured to the top panel of the head's skeleton.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Arms</h4>
                        <p>We replicated M-O's arms by basing them off of an off-centered ellipse. We decided to 3D
                            print the arms in order to ensure that the smooth, curved edges of the arms were present on
                            our version. 3D printing also allowed us to make cutouts in the arms that exactly matched
                            the bearings holding M-O's roller and the insertion point of the servo horn. One of our
                            initial prototypes used plywood laser cut arms while we were still working out the design of
                            the 3D printed arms.

                        </p>
                        <p>We additionally created a roller for M-O to hold, much like the one that he cleans with in
                            the movie. Unlike his movie counterpart, our M-O's roller is not powered; however, it is a
                            dead axle, meaning that it can spin. The roller was manufactured by 3D printing the main
                            cylinder and then attaching little extruded pieces to it that represent its texturing.

                        </p>

                        <h4>Shell</h4>
                        <p>The shell of the body was designed first as it determined the exterior dimensions and
                            appearance of a majority of the system. It was initially made as a hollowed out box with a
                            lofted front edge, and we made adjustments, mostly holes for mounting components, over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Initially, we were going to use a vacuum former to manufacture the shell; however, we
                            discovered that the vacuum former available to us had a height limit of 6''. While we could
                            have resized M-O to meet this constraint, we wanted to maintain accuracy to the movie and
                            started looking for other options. Since only the front and back panels actually have
                            curves, we decided to make the shell cover just those, as opposed to the whole body. We
                            laser cut acrylic to the dimensions that we wanted, mounted it to the skeleton, and then
                            used a heat gun to bend the acrylic over the corners that we wanted to be curved. Once all
                            of the panels were bent, we took them off and spray painted the interior with white,
                            allowing for a glossy finish and to reduce the likelihood of the paint coming off after
                            significant use. </p>

                        <h4>Controller</h4>
                        <p>We created a custom remote controller to pair with M-O.
                        </p>
                        <p>Reasons for custom controller:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Customization of buttons & locations based on what M-O does</li>
                            <li>Learning goals to work with various electrical components</li>
                            <li>Easy radio chip integration to communicate with M-O</li>
                            <li>Wanted an “old-school” style of controller</li>
                            <li>Shaped like WALL-E eyes!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>First, we determined the number of buttons we were able to put on M-O. The limiting factor
                            for number of buttons was how many pins we had available in an Arduino after connecting the
                            radio. Ultimately, we ended up having two joysticks and six buttons on the controller.
                        </p>
                        <p>Next, we decided what each of the electronics would do. We decided to follow a common
                            convention in video games where the left joystick controls player movement and made our left
                            joystick control M-O;s drivebase. Furthermore, we set the other joystick to control the head
                            movement, which ultimately ended up only being mechanically implemented in the x-direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also wanted to allow the controller to move the arms up and down slightly, so we put those
                            on the “bumpers”. Holding down this button will continue to move the arm in a single
                            direction until it hits our soft limit.
                        </p>
                        <p>The remaining four buttons were split between features and overall body animations. The
                            buttons on the left side are for animated expressions - specifically M-O being happy or
                            angry.
                            The buttons on the other side of the controller were for just M-O's face - one opens and
                            closes
                            the eyes depending on their current state, and the other cycles through the various
                            pre-programmed expressions he has.</p>
                        <p>After determining the button & joystick functions and layout, we started looking at other
                            electronics that needed to fit in the controller: an Arduino Nano, a 9V battery, and a radio
                            chip. These were moved around until they fit into a configuration with the other electronics
                            that kept the maximum size of the controller relatively close to that of a current Xbox
                            controller for maximum user comfort. The final configuration can be seen below:
                        </p>
                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Controller-1.png" alt="Controller 1" /></span>
                        <p>We then designed the body of the controller around the electronics, which went through three
                            revisions seen below:
                        </p>
                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Controller-2.png" alt="Controller 2" /></span>
                        <p>The initial version of the controller was a simple box around the electronics layout to give
                            us an idea for sizing.
                        </p>
                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Controller-3.png" alt="Controller 3" /></span>
                        <p>The second version of the controller was shaped based on WALL-E's eyes and “old-school”
                            controllers. The components fit together nicely into it, but there were a few problems with
                            the buttons falling into it when pressed due to lack of back support.
                        </p>
                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Controller-4.png" alt="Controller 4" /></span>
                        <p>The third and final version of the controller resolves some of the major issues form the
                            second version and also reduces the thickness of the overall model. It is a tight fit for
                            all of the components, though.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, we wired up the components. A few minor changes had to be made - including running a
                            power and ground rail on the inside of the controller, but overall, it was functional:
