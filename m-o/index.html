						<h3>Sprint 1 - "Box That Moves"</h3>
						<p>For the first sprint, we used a cardboard box to determine the final sizing for M-O. We also
							put wheels on said cardboard box and tested wireless joystick-controlled driving.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-chart-area accent3"></span>
						<h3>Sprint 2 - "Fancier Box That Moves"</h3>
						<p>For the second sprint, we used a laser-cut box to make a new version of M-O, this time with a
							head and arms. We also successfully installed a reachargable battery onto the main body of
							M-O. The
							16x32 RGB Matrix also arrived and we were able to get basic blinking eyes on M-O's face.</p>

						<h3>Sprint 3 - "It's a M-O"</h3>
						<p>For the third sprint, we made our laser-box more skeleton-like in order to prepare for the
							future shell going onto it. A new head and neck were made in order to support movement, and
							servos were added to mount the arms onto. The Matrix for the eyes were animated for two
							different expressions, and a physical iteration of the remote controller was completed. </p>
					</section>

						<span class="icon solid major fa-lock accent5"></span>
						<h3>Demo - "Holy S-M-O-Kes"</h3>
						<p>For the demo, we made the shell for our skeleton M-O and painted him white as well. We also
							made new, rounder arms as well as a backpack and proper roller to enhance his appearance. A
							lot of the software library integration with radio chips was also finalized.
