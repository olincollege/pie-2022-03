				<h3>Aditi Vinod</h3>
				<p>Aditi is an E:Computing major from San Jose, CA. For this project, she focused on firmware for the
					robot, specifically the servo movement and the RGB Matrix face and made the remote controller. She
					can typically be found in the largest library team room working on Formula, in Parking Lot D
					spinning fire, or in her dorm playing video games. She also never wants to wire a radio chip again.

				<h3>AJ Evans</h3>
				<p>AJ is an E:Robotics major from Westchester, NY. For this project, he focused on the electrical
					aspects of the motors, the electrical integration for the robot, and the power source.
					Embarrassingly, AJ had never soldered before this project, despite being the electrical point
					person. Throughout the project, he became increasingly obsessed with the neatness of the internal
					wiring, but he gave up after having to continuously rewire the same subsystems over and over. AJ is
					glad he did not have to rewire all the motors a sixth time. Outside of PIE, you can find him in his
					room knitting, playing the bass, or gaming. <br><br></p>

				<h3>Aja Capel</h3>
				<p>Aja is a Mech:E major from Champaign, IL. For this project she focused on the structural design for
					the body and the head. She loves anything and everything cars related and if she's not talking about
					cars she's probably talking about dinosaurs. If she's not doing either of those you can find her in
					her room sleeping or playing guitar. <br><br></p>

				<h3>Kate McCurley</h3>
				<p>Kate is an E:Robotics major from Wellesley, MA. For this project, she focused on creating our
					firmware, radio communication, and electronics design and assembly. She's enjoyed getting to work on
					designing and integrating both firmware and electrical components throughout working on M-O.

				<h3>Sela Domkofski</h3>
				<p>Sela is from Bethel, CT and has no idea what she's majoring in, but for this project she put on her
					Mech:E hat despite never having taken a mechanical class (unless DesNat counts). She worked on the
					robot's internal mechanics, fabrication, and generally tried to make things look nice. On the
					outside, at least. She also did a lot of soldering. Wires are scary. </p>
