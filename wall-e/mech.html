                <h3 class="major">Sustainability</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>A major goal for our project was to be as sustainable as possible. 
			This meant using scrap materials in the classroom from previous 
			projects to build most things in the rover. The body itself was 
			made by several trays of metal we found in one of the scrap bins. 
			They were not our ideal sizes, but we still decided to make use 
			of old scrap. Additionally, pieces used in the wheels were also 
			picked up from scrap bins. We are proud to say that most of our 
			rover is reused material. </p>

                <h3 class="major">Chasis</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>We wanted to design a chassis with a sleek design. We wanted minimal 
			protrusions as well as smooth sides. That said, we used scrap to 
			fabricate it so it was not as easy as we thought. We began with 
			the bottom of our rover. It was decided that the trays we chose 
			were slightly too long, so the piece had to be cut to size. Next, 
			we cut holes in the middle of the tray to cut down on weight. </p>

			<p>We then moved onto walls. Because of all the rails and bends that the 
			scrap metal had, we had to ideate for days to figure out how to 
			cut these down to size and keep the sides smooth. We finally 
			decided on a design which required us to shorten and narrow down
			the scrap trays as shown below.</p>

			<img src="images/sidecu.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
		    <p>
			To continue with our minimalist design, we decided
			we wanted the motors to be inside the rover. After we 3D printed a
			    motor mount, we marked the chassis for drilling. We were able to 
			install the motors with only the motor axles sticking out of small
			holes.</p>
		    <img src="images/mounts.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
			<img src="images/instmo.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>		
			<p> With this done, we simply added a lightweight layer on top
			as a cover which doubled as a place to mount the camera. The camera
			itself was connected to a motor that helped it pan left and right.
			It also had a protective casing that also kept it sturdy while the
			rover would move.</p>

                <h3 class="major">Wheels</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>With the chassis done, all we had left was the wheels. We looked for wheels
			in the scrap bins, but no wheels were big enough for our rover. We had
			to order some wheels using our budget. </p>
		    <img src="images/amawhee.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
			
			<p>These wheels, however, had a few
			issues. The main issue was that they came with bearings. The secondary
			issue was the weight of them. Thankfully, we were able to come up with
			solutions. The bearings issue was solved by taking the bearings out.
			This left a big hole in the middle of the wheel, so we took scrap metal
			and melted it into the hole. This allowed us to have a foundation for a
			3d printed piece that connected the wheel to the motor axles with a bolt.</p>
		    <img src="images/wheel.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
		    <p>
			The weight issue was bypassed by shaving off what we could from the wheels
			themselves. Since the inside of the wheel would be out of sight, we focused
			on chipping away at that. </p>
