								<p>Our mechanical system consists of a three axis gantry. The x and y axes are controlled by a belt and pulley system, while the z axis is a lead screw mechanism. The two y-plates are mounted directly to an extrusion structure, and each of them holds a linear rail and bearing, a pulley, a bearing, a belt, and a motor. The belt moves the linear bearing along the rail. The x-plate is mounted to one of the y-linear bearings on each side, and is perpendicular to the two y-plates. It has a similar layout to the y-axis plate, except that there is a ¼” steel piece holding the z plate. The motor controlling the lead screw is mounted to two 3d printed plates, along with two guide rails, which is then mounted to the z-axis plate (cut out of aluminum). The lead screw moves the extruder up and down.</p>
								<p>The extruder is a solenoid controlled zero differential valve with a ¼” nozzle lathed out of stainless steel to direct the flow of milk. Milk is poured into a funnel, which is connected to nylon tubing that feeds into the valve. This entire system rests on a structure made of aluminum extrusion. All parts used are food and heat safe, and can be cleaned by being flushed with hot water.</p>
								<p>The cup rests below the valve and nozzle, and is tilted side to side by a motor. All of our mechanisms are controlled by stepper motors (minus the solenoid-controlled valve).</p>
