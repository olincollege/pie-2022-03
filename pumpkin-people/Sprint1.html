										<p>At this stage, our <strong>MVP</strong> (minimum viable product) was a mechanism that used a spring-loaded marker to draw a design on a pumpkin.
										Meanwhile, our <strong>reach goal</strong> was to have a mechanism that would use a laser to raster an image onto a pumpkin.</p>
										<p>The <strong>current state</strong> of our project mainly included physical elements, where we had:
											<ul>
												<li>A rotating base</li>
												<li>A z-axis</li>
												<li>First level code that ran the motors</li>
												</ul>
										</p>

										<p>At this point all of our components were separate, and the next step was to integrate them together.</p>
										<p>In terms of our <strong>biggest technical risk</strong>, we were most concerned with the carriage that would be holding the spring-loaded pen.
										This was a very technical design that could have various potential problems, including friction, and sizing issues. The threaded rod used to move the carriage also posed as a problem due to its pitch and/or bow. Therefore we decided to perform a multitude of tests
										to insure that this system was in fact working properly.
										</p>
										<p>One thing we considered using for this project was a <strong>CNC shield</strong>, which was meant to help with the programming process.
										The CNC shield would control our XY plotter so that both of our motors would be able to work at the same time but at different speeds. In order
										to use this shield, though, we needed to understand a program called <strong>GRBL</strong>.
										</p>
										<p><strong>GRBL</strong> is an open sourse software that would enable motion control for CNC machines, and in face is commonly used
										in various small at-home CNC projects. It was developed for motion control for an Arduino microcontroller board, and uses a universal
										G-code sender (UGS) software that "sends" the G-code to the GRBL controller.
										</p>

										<P>In terms of our <strong>target goal</strong>, at this point we were optimistic about our progress and hoped 
										to integrate a laser into our design. Therefore, for our <strong>next deliverable</strong>, we wanted to ensure
										that we had a fully functional spring-loaded marker carriage and also fully integrated code that powers the motors and allows us to actually draw
										something onto a pumpkin.
										</P>
