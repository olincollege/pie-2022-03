													<h3><center><strong><u>Main Base</u></strong></center></h3>
												</header>
												<p>For the main base, we needed a design that would be able to withstand the weight of various sized pumpkins, while still being able to handle the same steps for a 360-degree motion.  </p>
												<p>In order to make the base we first needed to either find or design something that had smooth, easy rotation. This base would also need to be designed to handle large weight tolerances, while still allowing for an easy rotation. Instead of personally designing our own base, we instead searched for a well known physics stool base, otherwise known as a short, rotational stool base.</p>
												<p>After we had located and obtained the rotational base, we then needed to think about the specific attachments we would be needed in order to make it functional. After much consideration, the attachments we decided on were:
													<ul>
														<li>Electronics Base</li>
														<li>Stepper motor retainer</li>
														<li>Large flat plate with grippy add on</li>
														<li>Spike</li>
														<li>Gears for motor-to-base connection</li>
														</ul>
												</p>
												<p>For the <strong>electronics base</strong>, we simply cut a traingular shape out of acryllic and super glued it to the rotational base we had found, as shown in the images below.</p>
												
												<p>Our <strong>stepper motor retainer</strong> went through a few different stages, mainly due our change in motor types. The first design, depicted on the left,
												was a quick mock-up for testing. The final design, depicted on the right, was designed to snugly hold the motor
												in place, yet still allow for easy removal if needed (e.g. the open top design).</p>

												<p>The <strong>large flat plate</strong> was made from MDF, and was one of the first things we made in order to 
												test the weight capabilities of our base. We originally thought that we would need to make the plate out of a more
												robust material, but the MDF turned out to be a perfect, cheap solution to our plate, and there was no need to remove it.
												In respect to the grippy material, we used some general cabinet liner, cut it to the correct shape, and then stabled it
												to the plate. Again, we thought that this material would have to be replaced, but we were pleasantly suprised by the
												grip the material had, and therefore did not see the need to replace it.</p>

												<p>Our <strong>spike</strong> started off as a general 3D printed concept, which we hot glued to the extruding neck of our base.
												The overall concept of stabbing the pumpkins worked rather well, but our execution of the spike design was not
												the best, expecially since we kept loosing the spike in the pumpkins. Therefore, we decided to lathe our own spike and 
												epoxy it to our base, providing a cleaner, more effective design, and a more robust design that would
												survive for much longer.</p>

												<p>Finally, the gears for our motor-to-base connection were rather straight forward in design. We decided to go with a 3D 
													printed design since we had luck with such gears in the past.

													<h3><center><strong><u>Z-Axis</u></strong></center></h3>
												</header>
												<p>For the Z-axis, we needed a design that would be smooth in motion, applicable for a variety of radii, and also have allowance for a multitude of heights.</p>
												<p>In order to make the Z-axis, we first needed to create a list of all we would need for the design:
													<ul>
														<li>80-20 for main structure and movement abilities</li>
														<li>Carriage to hold our marker (and if we were to reach our reach goal our laser)</li>
														<li>Spring loaded design for allowing different radii</li>
														<li>80-20 caps to hold the bars in place</li>
														<li>Limit switches</li>
														<li>Threaded rod for carriage movement</li>
														<li>Motor to rod gear connection</li>
														<li>Sliding base</li>
													</ul>
												</p>
												
												<p>The <strong>pen carriage</strong> is a 3d printed piece. On the outside, it has bits that slot into the 80-20, and on the inside, the pen carriage contains 2 springs that slide freely in one direction, but are constrained in the two other directions. The outside spring is press fit into a pen collar which holds the sharpie such that it can slide with the spring when it needs to recess due to a radius or imperfection on the surface of our Pumpkins.

												<p>The bottom cap has a pocket for the motor that drives the threaded rod that drives the carriage. The motor has a large spur gear on its shaft, which drives a smaller gear attached to the threaded rod, which in turn moves the pen carriage. 
												</p>
												<p>In the top cap, there is a recessed area that houses a limit switch. The wires of the limit switch are fed out through the top, then down the outside of the 80-20 with PLA wire clips</p>

												<p>For our motor to rod <strong>gear connection</strong>, we had a large gear on the motor and a small gear on the rod in order to have a high gear ratio, and therefore allow the rod to move at a quick pace.

												<p>In order to deal with pumpkins of many different radii, we put the entire z-axis assembly on an 80-20 sliding base. We used T-nuts attached to the rest of the assembly so the axis can be positioned and locked.
